TESTS

Visualisation of:

    Results.  How good classifier is
    Crossover: Ho resources are allocated inside loop
    Trees: graphviz

Wrapper to write config file and to start simulation

Mechanism to pause a simulation

Mechanism to change parameters during a run (signal?)

Wrapper to monitor a simulation and run classifiers on test data hile
simulation still running

ADFs.  Very important.

Cataloguing of sub-trees.  Finding building blocks.

Measure of diversity in population.

Quality progress reporting, controlled by run time configuration
