Run: target/release/gp <Config file>

Config file is a record per line space delimited key/value file.  The first word on the line is the key, the rest of the line is the value.

must have:

birthsanddeaths_filename: File name that has all records of individual programmes created or destroyed.

copy_prob: 0-100 The best <copy_prob>% trees are copied straight to the next generation each new generation.

crossover_percent: At most <crossover_percent>% of the new generation is created by crossover.

data_file: The file name of the input data

generations_file: Each generation a summary is written to this file name.

max_population 10000 The number of individuals, maximum (but essentially exact) in the population

mutate_prob: Each generation <mutate_prob>% of the trees are mutated and inserted into the next generation.

name: This is the name of the simulation and is used to constract file paths.  Files concerning a simulation are at: <root_dir>/Data/<name>/ except for the configuration file that can be anywhere and is named on the command line.

num_generations: How many generations to do.

reload: If "true" (exact spelling) the simulation is initialised from the <save_file> rather than randomly

root_dir: The home of the `Data` directory 

save_file: Each  generatin the population is saved to a file of this name

seed: A usize that seeds the random number generator

training_percent: Perentage of the data to use for training.  Testing uses 100-<training_percent> of the data
